Module Name: Task Assignment Optimization Problem Solution

Description:
This module contains the solution for the Task Assignment Optimization Problem.
The solution is divided into several sections, each responsible for a specific task:
1. Data Input: Functions to read and validate input data for the task assignment problem.
2. Optimization Model: Implementation of the optimization model using appropriate algorithms.
3. Constraints and Objectives: Definition of constraints and objective functions used in the optimization.
4. Solution Execution: Functions to execute the optimization model and obtain results.
5. Output Processing: Functions to format and output the results in a user-friendly manner.

Functions:
- s1_data_structure(employee_path, task_path): Pre-process and structure employee and task data.
- s2_construct_model(license_path): Construct the optimization model with specified parameters.
- s3_decision_variable(model, tasks, employees, company_tasks): Define decision variables for the model.
- s4_constraint(model, x, y, z, employees, company_tasks, story_points, max_workload): Set constraints for the optimization model.
- s5_objective1(model, employees, company_tasks, y, score, story_points, max_employee_workload, mu_Z_star): Minimize the idle employee.
- s6_objective2(model, employees, company_tasks, z, score, story_points, max_employee_workload, mu_Z_star): Maximize the assessment score.
- s7_objective3(model, employees, company_tasks, score, story_points, max_employee_workload, max_workload, mu_Z_star): Balance the workload for each employee.
- s8_MOO(model, employees, company_tasks, score, story_points, max_employee_workload, mu_Z_1, mu_Z_2, mu_Z_3, mu_Z_star, assessment_score_1, assessment_score_2, assessment_score_3): Multi-Objective Optimization using Goal Programming.

Classes:
- GapCallback: A callback class to report optimization progress and gap.

Usage:
Import the module in requirement file and yippy file to process the assessment.
The solution can be executed by running the main() function, which orchestrates
the entire workflow from data input to output processing.

Example:
    from task_assignment_optimization import main

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
